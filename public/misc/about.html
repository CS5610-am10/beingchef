            <strong>Welcome to BeingChef!!!</strong>
            <p>
                BeingChef is all about solving the 'What should we make tonight?' problem for you.
                It enables enthusiastic cooks to experiment different cuisines, save favorite recipes for future
                reference, provide productive comments on recipes, for example: providing an alternative ingredient.
                It also provides users an easy way to fill their grocery lists with the ingredients of a paricular recipe that they
                are viewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, one of the important motivations behind building this web application is to address a section of
                population, especially students, that move away from home and are burdened with the responsibility to cook for
                themselves. BeingChef is designed to address that burden.
